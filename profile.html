				<p>I'm a 20 year old graphic design student at the Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen. I live in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. Greatest city on earth. It's my first year of graphic design, before that I studied 2 years of architecture at the Artesis Hogeschool and the Univerity of Antwerp. Besides making design in a graphical way, I like to make sketches of buildings, 3D-drawings, doodling, and I also make beats. I like to combine all of my creativity in to one. Wheter it's designing or making music, I like to get inspired by the works of other people, such as design, architecture or music. Besides school, i like to travel a lot to countries where the sun never comes down. I also work at a chinese restaurant in the weekends and in the summers I work at a music festival.
